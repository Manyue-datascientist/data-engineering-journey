# 📦 Week 1: Big Data – The Big Picture

Welcome to Week 1 of my 26-week Data Engineering journey! This week sets the stage for everything that follows — we explore how data evolved from simple databases to massive distributed ecosystems.

This isn't just a theory dump — it's a story-driven learning diary that connects **why**, **what**, and **how** across concepts. Whether you're revisiting months later or learning for the first time, these notes aim to be **doubt-free**, **self-contained**, and **job-focused**.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- What is Big Data? (The 5 Vs)
- Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
- The Birth of Distributed Systems
- Hadoop Architecture and Ecosystem
- Why Spark Replaced MapReduce
- Cloud vs On-Premise – The Real Shift
- Databases vs Data Warehouses vs Data Lakes
- Understanding HDFS Internals
- The Role of a Data Engineer in All This

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Traditional databases broke down due to scale, variety, and velocity of data.
- Hadoop introduced distributed storage (HDFS) and processing (MapReduce).
- Spark revolutionized Big Data by keeping things in-memory, enabling streaming & ML.
- Cloud computing solved infrastructure headaches: **scale, cost, and speed**.
- The evolution from **DB → DWH → DL → Lakehouse** is key to modern architecture.
- HDFS is the blueprint for distributed, fault-tolerant storage.
- As Data Engineers, our role is to understand this entire flow — and build scalable, resilient systems on top.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Understanding this "big picture" helps you:
- Know **why each tool exists**, not just what it does.
- Make **architectural decisions** in interviews & real projects.
- Avoid treating tools as buzzwords — instead, see them as **problem solvers**.
