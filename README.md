# 🚀 Data Engineering Journey

A week-by-week, hands-on path to becoming a **production-ready Data Engineer**.  
This repo is organized by week; each folder contains a focused `README.md`, plus **Glossary**, **Notes**, **Summary**, and any **labs/assignments/code** for that week.

---

## 📂 How to Navigate

Each week folder follows the same pattern:
- `README.md` — the week's overview & what was built
- `Glossary.md` — quick revision bullets
- `Notes.md` — cleaned, mentor-style notes
- `Summary.md` — 2–3 minute recap
- (optional) lab notebooks / assignments / diagrams

## 📆 Weeks Completed

### 1) Week 1 — Big Data: The Big Picture
- 5Vs of Big Data, **monolithic vs distributed**
- Hadoop overview: **HDFS / MapReduce / YARN**
- Databases vs **Data Warehouse** vs **Data Lake**
- Role of a Data Engineer, cloud mapping (AWS/Azure/GCP)

📁 Folder: [`Week1 Big Data - The Big Picture`](./Week1%20Big%20Data%20-%20The%20Big%20Picture/)

### 2) Week 2 — Distributed Storage & Data Lake
- HDFS internals: **NameNode/DataNode**, blocks, replication, **rack awareness**, federation
- Linux & HDFS CLI (put/get/ls/cp/mv/fsck)
- **HDFS vs Cloud Data Lakes** (S3/ADLS/GCS): block vs object, decoupled compute

📁 Folder: [`Week2 Distributed Storage & Data Lake`](./Week2%20Distributed%20Storage%20&%20Data%20Lake/)  
- [README](./Week2%20Distributed%20Storage%20&%20Data%20Lake/README.md) 
- [Glossary](./Week2%20Distributed%20Storage%20&%20Data%20Lake/Week2_Glossary.md)

### 3) Week 3 — Distributed Processing Fundamentals
- MapReduce pipeline: **RecordReader → Map → (Combiner) → Partition → Shuffle → Sort → Reduce**
- **Reducers**: when to increase, when to set to 0, custom partitioner
- Real-world pattern: **Inverted Index** (search), **Sensor max per day**
- **Apache Spark** intro: RDDs, lazy eval, DAG, memory vs disk I/O
- Coding: **Word Count with RDD API** (load → flatMap → map → reduceByKey → save)

📁 Folder: [`Week 3 Distributed Processing Fundamentals`](./Week%203%20Distributed%20Processing%20Fundamentals/)  
- [README](./Week%203%20Distributed%20Processing%20Fundamentals/README.md)
